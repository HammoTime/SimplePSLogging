# SimplePSLogging
A simple PowerShell logging library.

This library is provides a few key functions to have nice console output in the format of:
  [DATE] [MSGTYPE]: MESSAGE.

  Example:
  [01/01/2016] [INFO]: This is my message.

This is just a format that I'm a fan of. The library also allows you to enable logging of the output to text file simultaneously.

Please let me know if you find any bugs.
